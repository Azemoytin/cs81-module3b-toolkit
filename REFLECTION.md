The patterns or surprises I noticed was that it was just simple math so the logic was very simple and repetitive. Every function I added outputted a predicted result so it was easy to create and follow.

The logic that challenged my thinking was all about remembering how each function operated to produce each output. Even though the math was simple the output might have been differen or even wrong.

This kind of toolkit might be used in the real world by being a part of some sort of math related website, game, calculator, or app that needs to input this basic math.
